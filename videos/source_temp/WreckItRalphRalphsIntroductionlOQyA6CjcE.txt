my
name's
Ralph
and
I'm
a
bad
guy
let's
see
I'm
nine
feet
tall
I
weigh
pounds
got
a
little
bit
of
a
temper
on
me
my
passion
bubble
is
very
near
the
surface
I
guess
I'm
not
gonna
lie
anyhoo
what
else
I'm
a
wrecker
I
wrecked
things
professionally
I
mean
I'm
very
good
at
what
I
do
probably
the
best
I
know
the
thing
is
fixing
is
the
name
of
the
game
literally
fix-it
Felix
jr.
so
yeah
naturally
the
guy
with
the
name
fix-it
Felix
is
the
good
guy
he's
nice
enough
his
good
guys
go
definitely
fix
his
stuff
really
well
but
if
you've
got
a
magic
hammer
from
your
father
how
hard
can
it
be
if
he
was
a
regular
contractor
carpenter
guy
I
guarantee
you
you
would
not
be
able
to
fix
the
damage
that
I
do
as
quickly
when
Felix
does
a
good
job
he
gets
a
medal
but
are
their
medals
for
wrecking
stuff
really
well
to
that
I
say
ha
and
no
there
aren't
thirty
years
of
in
doing
this
and
I've
seen
a
lot
of
other
games
come
and
go
kind
of
sad
think
about
all
those
guys
from
asteroids
boom
gone
centipede
who
knows
where
that
guy
is
you
know
look
a
steady
arcade
gig
is
nothing
to
sneeze
ax
I'm
very
lucky
it's
just
I
gotta
say
it
becomes
kind
of
hard
to
love
your
job
when
no
one
seems
to
like
you
for
doing
I'll
clear
the
arcades
close
sure
you
can
oooh
what
a
day
so
you
want
to
head
to
tappers
ken
have
your
buying
buddy
ah
maybe
I
wouldn't
be
feeling
this
way
if
things
were
different
after
work
but
it
is
what
it
is
Felix
and
the
nice
Landers
go
hang
out
in
their
homes
which
is
just
fixed
and
everyone
you
know
they
go
to
their
homes
I
go
to
mine
which
happens
to
be
a
dump
and
when
I
say
a
dump
I
don't
mean
like
a
shabby
place
I
mean
an
actual
dump
the
garbage
goes
and
a
bunch
of
bricks
and
smash
building
parts
that's
that's
what
I
call
home
I
guess
I
can't
Billy
ate
too
much
I
got
my
bricks
I
got
my
stump
it
looks
uncomfortable
it's
actually
fine
I'm
good
but
if
I'm
really
honest
with
myself
I
see
Felix
up
there
getting
patted
on
the
back
people
giving
him
pie
thanking
him
so
happy
to
see
him
all
the
time
some
time
to
think
man
sure
must
be
nice
being
the
good
guy
