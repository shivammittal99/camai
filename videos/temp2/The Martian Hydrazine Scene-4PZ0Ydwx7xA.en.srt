1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
take hydrogen you add oxygen you burn

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:09,809
now I have hundreds of liters of unused

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,540
hydrazine at the MDV if I run the

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,419
hydrazine over an Iridium catalyst it'll

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,910
separate into n2 and h2 and then if I

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,010
just direct the hydrogen into a small

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,680
area and burn it luckily in the history

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,570
of humanity nothing bad has ever

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,610
happened from gliding hydrogen on fire

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,420
NASA hates fire because of the whole

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,130
fire makes everybody die in space thing

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,920
so everything they sent us up here with

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:46,229
his flames argued with the notable

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,720
exception of Martinez's personal items

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,800
I am sorry Martinez but if you didn't

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,149
want me to go through your stuff you

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,390
should know left me for dead on a

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,979
desolate planet by the way I'm figuring

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,300
you're going to be fine with this given

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,300
my present situation counting on you

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:44,640
so yeah I blew myself up best guess

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,700
I forgot to account for the excess

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,590
oxygen

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,340
I've been exhaling I did my calculations

25
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,340
because I'm stupid

26
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:06,310
I'm gonna get back to work here just as

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:07,930
soon as my ears stop ringing interesting

28
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,840
side note this is actually how the jet

29
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,600
propulsion lab was founded five guys at

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,670
Caltech trying to make rocket fuel and

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,980
they nearly burned down their dorm and

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,510
rather than expel them banished them to

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:29,820
a nearby farm told him to keep working

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,820
now we have a space program okay
