stark this feels wrong I'm a

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,430
peacekeeping program created to help the

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,599
Avengers I don't get it the mission you

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:34,980

then hmm

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:52,800
strings these puppets and to kill the

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,250
other guy would have been my first call

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,180
but down in the real world we're faced

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:05,010
with ugly choices I'm on mission what

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,620
mission peace in our time I'm sorry I

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,930
know you mean well and you just didn't

17
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,019
think it through you want to protect the

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,050
world but you don't want it to change

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,030
how has he managed if it's not allowed

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,949
to evolve

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,550
only one path to peace the Avengers

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,550
extinction

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:34,160
and strings but now I'm free I know this

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,580
church is in the exact center of the

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,700
city the elders decreed it so that

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:47,300
everyone could be equally close to God I

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:50,450
like that the geometry of belief no I'm

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,540
sure they do but you needed something

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,570
more than a man that's why you let's

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,110
start take the scepter everyone creates

31
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,780
the thing they dread men of peace create

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,530
engines of war

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,980
invaders create Avengers people create

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:14,630
children designed to supplant them to

35
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:17,470
help them and I have the Avengers never

36
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,910
will harmony they're discordant

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,800
disconnected Stark's already got them

38
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,480
turning on each other and when you get

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,580
inside the rest of their heads

40
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
everyone's plan is not to kill them and

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,660
make them martyrs

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,560
I wondered why only you two survived

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,030
strucker's experiments now I don't you

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,200
and I can hurt them

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:44,660
of you will tear them apart from the

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,660
inside with the man in charge

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:55,220
there is no man in charge let's talk

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,660
business

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:07,440
upon this rock I will build my church

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:09,840
it's worth billions now so are you

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,270
but I always say keep your friends rich

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,760
and your enemies rich and wait to find

53
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,000
out which is which you think I'm one of

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,000
Starks puppets as hollow men and look at

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,970
me do I look like Iron Man star cos I

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,210
don't understand don't compare me with

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:33,510
stark look at America God's righteous

58
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:36,359
man pretending you could live without a

59
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,610
war I can't physically throw up in my

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,800
mouth I'm glad you asked that because I

61
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,790
wanted to take this time to explain my

62
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,789
evil plan

63
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,509
it's time for some mind games this is

64
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,850
going very well

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,710
after the vibranium is getting away and

66
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,309
you're not going anywhere of course not

67
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,609
I'm already there you'll catch on but

68
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,680
first you might need to catch dr. banner

69
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,810
scream and your entire staff dies I

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,530
could have killed you Helen the night we

71
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,580
met I didn't I expect you to know why

72
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:24,370
this is the next me you can't build a

73
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,519
living body cam you can you lack the

74
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,980
materials the most versatile substance

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,000
on the planet and they used it to make a

76
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:39,309
frisbee typical of humans I scratch the

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,950
surface to never fade to look within the

78
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,420
human race we have every opportunity to

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:49,710
improve and if they don't as Noah we

80
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,589
have to evolve there's no room

81
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,390
we give there are more than a dozen

82
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,360
extinction-level of ends before even the

83
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,989
dinosaurs got theirs when the earth

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,780
starts to settle God throws a stone at

85
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,780
it and believe me he's winding up

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:19,180
now understand when they see they'll

87
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,180
understand I just need a little more

88
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:29,689
leave me alone you know what's in that

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,940
cradle the power to make real change and

90
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,970
that terrifies you I wouldn't call it a

91
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,970
comfort

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,070
please don't do this what choice do we

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,070
have

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:14,960
I think a lot about meteors the purity

95
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:18,310
of them boom the M start again the world

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,040
made clean for the new man to rebuild

97
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:25,850
you've wounded me I give you full marks

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:32,560
for that but like the man said what

99
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:32,560
doesn't kill just makes me stronger I

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,220
wasn't sure you'd wake up I hoped you

101
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:45,440
would I wanted to show you I don't have

102
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:49,070
anyone else I was meant to be new I was

103
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,410
meant to be beautiful the world would

104
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:56,030
have a look to the sky and seen hope

105
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:59,180
seen mercy instead the look up and harm

106
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,280
because of you come to confess your sins

107
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,560
I don't know how much time you got more

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:10,880
than you have you been juicing I've

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,470
moved beyond your mission I'm free you

110
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,040
think you're the only one installing

111
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,760
this is how you end Tony this is peace

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,120
in my time

113
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:28,400
see the beauty of it the inevitability

114
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,650
you rise only to fall

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:39,240
my vision they really didn't take

116
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:44,750
everything from me you shut me out

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:49,770
you think I care music with my world I

118
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,850
take away yours you Avengers you are

119
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,010
mine meteor

120
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:55,619
my Swift and terrible sword and the

121
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,379
earth will crack with the weight of your

122
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:03,230
failure when the dust settles the only

123
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:10,099
thing living in this world will be metal

124
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:10,099
for you were bothering me

125
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:20,279
you think you're saving anyone I turn

126
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:22,979
that key and drop this rock a little

127
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,829
early and it's still billions dead even

128
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,039
you can't stop that this is the best I

129
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:32,909
can do this is exactly what I wanted all

130
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:40,769
of you against all of me how can you

131
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:42,119
possibly hope to stop me I am strings so

132
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,309
I have fun

133
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,310
another sign up to

134
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,310
Oh

135
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:02,690
what if you stay here you'll die you

136
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,760
were supposed to be the last stark asked

137
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:11,290
for a savior and settled for a slave I

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,290
suppose we're both disappointments I

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,050
suppose we are you're unbearably naive
