1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:10,520
there will be no foolish wand-waving or

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:13,340
silly incantations in this class as such

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,949
I don't expect many of you to appreciate

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:18,099
the subtle science and exact art that is

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:28,339
potion making however for those select

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:31,430
few who possess the predisposition I can

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,180
teach you how to bewitch the mind and

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:39,350
ensnare the senses I can tell you how to

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:49,789
bottle fame brew glory and even put a

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:51,410
stopper in death then again maybe some

11
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,479
of you have come to Hogwarts in

12
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:56,779
possession of abilities so formidable

13
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:00,819
that you feel confident enough to not

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,820
pay attention

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:17,410
mr. Potter our new celebrity tell me

16
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,059
what would I get if I added powdered

17
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:26,229
root of asphodel to an infusion of

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:27,940
wormwood you don't know well let's try

19
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,709
again where mr. Potter would you look at

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,710
if I asked you to find me a bezoar I

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,780
don't know sir

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:42,449
and what is the difference between

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:50,860
monkshood and wolfbane I don't know sir

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:53,940
petty clearly Fame isn't everything is

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,940
