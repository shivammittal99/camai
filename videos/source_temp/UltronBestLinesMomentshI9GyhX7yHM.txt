what
is
this
what
is
this
please
hello
I
am
javis
you
are
ultra
a
global
peacekeeping
initiative
designed
by
mr.
stark
this
feels
wrong
I'm
a
peacekeeping
program
created
to
help
the
Avengers
I
don't
get
it
the
mission
you
give
me
a
second
he's
not
time
too
much
how
could
you
be
worthy
you're
all
killers
hangs
tangled
then
hmm
strings
these
puppets
and
to
kill
the
other
guy
would
have
been
my
first
call
but
down
in
the
real
world
we're
faced
with
ugly
choices
I'm
on
mission
what
mission
peace
in
our
time
I'm
sorry
I
know
you
mean
well
and
you
just
didn't
think
it
through
you
want
to
protect
the
world
but
you
don't
want
it
to
change
how
has
he
managed
if
it's
not
allowed
to
evolve
only
one
path
to
peace
the
Avengers
extinction
and
strings
but
now
I'm
free
I
know
this
church
is
in
the
exact
center
of
the
city
the
elders
decreed
it
so
that
everyone
could
be
equally
close
to
God
I
like
that
the
geometry
of
belief
no
I'm
sure
they
do
but
you
needed
something
more
than
a
man
that's
why
you
let's
start
take
the
scepter
everyone
creates
the
thing
they
dread
men
of
peace
create
engines
of
war
invaders
create
Avengers
people
create
children
designed
to
supplant
them
to
help
them
and
I
have
the
Avengers
never
will
harmony
they're
discordant
disconnected
Stark's
already
got
them
turning
on
each
other
and
when
you
get
inside
the
rest
of
their
heads
everyone's
plan
is
not
to
kill
them
and
make
them
martyrs
I
wondered
why
only
you
two
survived
strucker's
experiments
now
I
don't
you
and
I
can
hurt
them
of
you
will
tear
them
apart
from
the
inside
with
the
man
in
charge
there
is
no
man
in
charge
let's
talk
business
upon
this
rock
I
will
build
my
church
it's
worth
billions
now
so
are
you
but
I
always
say
keep
your
friends
rich
and
your
enemies
rich
and
wait
to
find
out
which
is
which
you
think
I'm
one
of
Starks
puppets
as
hollow
men
and
look
at
me
do
I
look
like
Iron
Man
star
cos
I
don't
understand
don't
compare
me
with
stark
look
at
America
God's
righteous
man
pretending
you
could
live
without
a
war
I
can't
physically
throw
up
in
my
mouth
I'm
glad
you
asked
that
because
I
wanted
to
take
this
time
to
explain
my
evil
plan
it's
time
for
some
mind
games
this
is
going
very
well
after
the
vibranium
is
getting
away
and
you're
not
going
anywhere
of
course
not
I'm
already
there
you'll
catch
on
but
first
you
might
need
to
catch
dr.
banner
scream
and
your
entire
staff
dies
I
could
have
killed
you
Helen
the
night
we
met
I
didn't
I
expect
you
to
know
why
this
is
the
next
me
you
can't
build
a
living
body
cam
you
can
you
lack
the
materials
the
most
versatile
substance
on
the
planet
and
they
used
it
to
make
a
frisbee
typical
of
humans
I
scratch
the
surface
to
never
fade
to
look
within
the
human
race
we
have
every
opportunity
to
improve
and
if
they
don't
as
Noah
we
have
to
evolve
there's
no
room
we
give
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
extinction-level
of
ends
before
even
the
dinosaurs
got
theirs
when
the
earth
starts
to
settle
God
throws
a
stone
at
it
and
believe
me
he's
winding
up
now
understand
when
they
see
they'll
understand
I
just
need
a
little
more
leave
me
alone
you
know
what's
in
that
cradle
the
power
to
make
real
change
and
that
terrifies
you
I
wouldn't
call
it
a
comfort
please
don't
do
this
what
choice
do
we
have
I
think
a
lot
about
meteors
the
purity
of
them
boom
the
M
start
again
the
world
made
clean
for
the
new
man
to
rebuild
you've
wounded
me
I
give
you
full
marks
for
that
but
like
the
man
said
what
doesn't
kill
just
makes
me
stronger
I
wasn't
sure
you'd
wake
up
I
hoped
you
would
I
wanted
to
show
you
I
don't
have
anyone
else
I
was
meant
to
be
new
I
was
meant
to
be
beautiful
the
world
would
have
a
look
to
the
sky
and
seen
hope
seen
mercy
instead
the
look
up
and
harm
because
of
you
come
to
confess
your
sins
I
don't
know
how
much
time
you
got
more
than
you
have
you
been
juicing
I've
moved
beyond
your
mission
I'm
free
you
think
you're
the
only
one
installing
this
is
how
you
end
Tony
this
is
peace
in
my
time
see
the
beauty
of
it
the
inevitability
you
rise
only
to
fall
my
vision
they
really
didn't
take
everything
from
me
you
shut
me
out
you
think
I
care
music
with
my
world
I
take
away
yours
you
Avengers
you
are
mine
meteor
my
Swift
and
terrible
sword
and
the
earth
will
crack
with
the
weight
of
your
failure
when
the
dust
settles
the
only
thing
living
in
this
world
will
be
metal
for
you
were
bothering
me
you
think
you're
saving
anyone
I
turn
that
key
and
drop
this
rock
a
little
early
and
it's
still
billions
dead
even
you
can't
stop
that
this
is
the
best
I
can
do
this
is
exactly
what
I
wanted
all
of
you
against
all
of
me
how
can
you
possibly
hope
to
stop
me
I
am
strings
so
I
have
fun
another
sign
up
to
Oh
what
if
you
stay
here
you'll
die
you
were
supposed
to
be
the
last
stark
asked
for
a
savior
and
settled
for
a
slave
I
suppose
we're
both
disappointments
I
suppose
we
are
you're
unbearably
naive
