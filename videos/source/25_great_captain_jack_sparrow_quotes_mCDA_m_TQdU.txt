when
you
marooned
me
on
that
godforsaken
spit
of
land
you
forgot
one
very
important
thing
mate
I'm
Captain
Jack
Sparrow
oh
no
I'm
picky
picky
mum
means
he
wheezy
once
I
say
eunuch
why
should
I
sail
with
any
of
you
flora
we
have
tried
to
kill
me
in
the
past
one
of
you
succeeded
welcome
to
the
Caribbean
left
hey
thanks
there's
something
hey
Cheerilee
have
you
now
very
kind
of
you
but
it
would
seem
that
as
I
possess
a
ship
and
you
don't
you're
the
ones
in
need
of
rescuing
I'm
not
sure
as
I'm
in
the
mood
I
see
my
ship
right
there
can't
spot
it
must
be
a
tiny
little
thing
hiding
somewhere
behind
a
pearl
you
are
without
doubt
the
worst
pirate
but
you
have
heard
of
me
because
you
and
I
are
alike
and
they
were
coming
there
when
you
had
the
chance
to
show
it
to
do
the
right
thing
I
love
those
moments
I
like
to
wave
at
them
as
they
pass
by
well
that
is
a
dinghy
my
vessel
is
magnificent
and
fierce
and
huge
fish
why
then
I
confess
it
is
my
intention
to
commandeer
one
of
these
ships
pick
up
a
crew
in
Tortuga
raid
pillage
plunder
and
otherwise
pill
for
my
Weasley
blackouts
out
I
seek
no
noise
I
think
he's
telling
the
truth
if
he
was
telling
the
truth
he
wouldn't
have
told
us
unless
of
course
he
knew
you
wouldn't
believe
the
truth
even
if
he
told
it
this
is
the
day
you
always
remember
is
the
day
that
you
almost
getting
Jack
Sparrow
made
you
captain
just
giving
the
blood
-
you're
not
a
eunuch
are
you
ah
you
may
kill
me
but
you
may
never
insult
me
Who
am
I
Captain
Jack
Sparrow
why
is
the
wrong
guy
I'd
the
wrong
shoot
a
man
can
understand
this
shoot
his
tongue
trim
that
scraggly
beard
I'll
tell
you
mate
if
every
town
in
the
world
will
like
this
one
a
no
man
would
ever
feel
unwanted
Gisele

we
don't
have
the
key
we
can't
open
whatever
it

any
sense

I
can
get
if
you
were
waiting
for
the
opportune
moment
that
was
is
now
if
you'd
be
so
kind
to
be
much
of
us
if
you

me
off

low
price

been
too
long
hasn't
it
I
illegitimate
I
remember
you
shot
me
Darden

you
scabrous

bring
me
that
horizon
and
