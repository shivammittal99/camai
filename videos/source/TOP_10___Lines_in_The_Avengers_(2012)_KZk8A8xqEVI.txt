big
man
in
a
suit
of
armor
take
that
off
what
are
you
genius
billionaire
playboy
philanthropist
what's
it
look
like
in
there
it
seems
to
run
on
some
form
of
electricity
mom
you're
not
wrong
I
won't
touch
Barton
not
until
I
make
him
kill
you
slowly
intimately
in
every
way
he
knows
you
fear
and
then
he'll
wake
just
long
enough
to
see
his
good
work
and
when
he
screams
I'll
split
his
skull
this
is
my
bargain
you
mewling
quim
cuz
we
can't
protect
the
Earth
you
can
be
damn
well
sure
we'll
avenge
it
how
will
your
friends
have
time
for
me
when
they're
so
busy
fighting
you
it's
usually
works
well
performance
issues
you
know
not
uncommon
one
out
of
five
director
fury
the
council
has
made
a
decision
I
recognize
the
council
has
made
a
decision
but
given
that
it's
a
stupid-ass
decision
I've
elected
to
ignore
it
to
when
they
come
and
they
will
they'll
come
for
you
I
have
an
army
we
have
a
Hulk
do
not
touch
me
again
then
don't
take
my
stuff
you
have
no
idea
what
you're
dealing
with
uh
Shakespeare
in
the
Park
doth
smother
no
you
wear
as
her
drapes
oh
he's
not
leading
an
army
from
here
I
don't
think
we
should
be
focusing
on
Loki
that
guy's
brain
is
a
bag
full
of
cats
he
could
smell
crazy
on
him
I've
cared
how
you
speak
Loki's
beyond
reason
but
he
is
of
Asgard
and
he's
my
brother
he
killed
people
in
two
days
he's
adopted
dr.
banner
now
might
be
a
really
good
time
for
you
to
get
angry
that's
my
secret
captain
I'm
always
angry
get
up
you
all
of
you
beneath
me
I
am
a
god
you
dull
creature
and
I
will
not
be
bullied
by
puny
God
you
