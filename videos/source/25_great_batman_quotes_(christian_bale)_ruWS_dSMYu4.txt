I'm
going
to
show
the
people
of
Gotham
their
city
doesn't
belong
to
the
criminals
in
the
corrupt
people
need
dramatic
examples
to
shake
them
out
of
apathy
and
I
can't
do
that
as
Bruce
Wayne
as
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
I
can
be
ignored
I
can
be
destroyed
but
as
a
symbol
but
a
symbol
I
can
be
incorruptible
I
can
be
everlasting
what
simple
something
elemental
something
terrifying
I'm
Batman
nice
coat
the
idea
was
to
be
a
symbol
that
man
that
was
the
point
if
you're
working
alone
wear
a
mask
not
afraid
to
be
seen
standing
up
these
guys
I'm
asking
out
for
you
is
to
protect
the
people
you
care
about
count
to
five
then
throw
this
blocks
the
remote
detonator
signal
to
the
ball
get
it
onto
it
before
sunrise
if
I'd
hit
the
button
when
it
starts
when
what
starts
or
what
is
that
Beckham
I
swear
word
of
me
from
one
professional
to
another
if
you're
trying
to
scare
somebody
pick
a
better
spot
on
this
site
for
wouldn't
kill
me
I'm
counting
on
it
who
where
are
they
I
don't
know
where
he
is
he
found
us
he
must
have
friends
where
I
Oh
here
ah
you're
a
guard
made
your
kills
for
money
look
if
this
man
is
everything
that
you
say
he
is
in
the
city
what
gives
you
the
right
what's
the
difference
between
you
and
me
I'm
not
wearing
hockey
pads
yeah
who
are
you
pretending
to
be
Bruce
Wayne
eccentric
really
everybody
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
coming
here
tonight
and
drinking
all
of
my
booze
not
really
there's
a
thing
about
being
a
Wayne
that
you're
never
short
of
a
few
freeloaders
like
yourselves
to
fill
up
your
mansion
with
so
here's
to
you
people
thank
you
that's
enough
oh
well
no
not
finished
taller

uh
all
you
phonies
all
you
two-faced
friends

sycophant
ik
suck-ups
whoo
smile
through
your
teeth
at
me
please
leave
me
in
peace
please
go
stop
smiling

not
a
joke
please
leave
the
party's
over
get
out
sir
the
pool
is
for
decoration
and
your
friends
do
not
have
swimming
well
I'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
leave
it
is
not
a
question
of
money
you
see
I'm
buying
this
hotel
and
setting
some
new
rules
about
the
pool
area
that's
mr.
Waynes
now
so
that's
a
very
brave
thing
you
did
trying
to
catch
the
light
well
you
you
weren't
protecting
the
van
y-you
know
you
think
I
should
go
to
the
hospital
you
don't
watch
a
whole
lot
of
news
Steve
mr.
Winn
I
believe
in
Harvey
Dent
I
had
to
find
a
way
to
stop
them
trying
to
kill
me
you
made
a
serious
mistake
I
won't
kill
you
but
I
don't
have
to
save
him
you
know
it's
you
know
how
I
got
these
scars
no
but
I
know
how
you
got
me
tell
me
where
the
trash
then
you
have
my
permission
to
die
are
you
doing
what's
necessary
my
friend
with
a
joke
God
needs
it's
true
realtor
hero
or
you
live
long
enough
to
see
yourself
become
the
villain
I
get
no
sense
as
I'm
not
a
hero
I
like
that
I
killed
those
people
that's
what
I
can
be
no
no
you
can't
you're
not
I'm
whatever
Gotham
needs
me
to
me
and
the
people
know
the
hero
who
saved
them
hero
can
be
anyone
even
a
man
who
looks
something
as
simple
and
reassuring
as
putting
a
coat
around
young
boys
shoulders
to
let
him
know
the
world
and
you
