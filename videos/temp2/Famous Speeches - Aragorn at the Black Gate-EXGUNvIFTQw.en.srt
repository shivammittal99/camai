00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:24,140
my brother I see in your eyes the same

2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,140
fear that would take the heart for me a

3
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,599
day may come when the courage of men

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,270
fails when we forsake our friends and

5
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,229
break all bonds of fellowship but it is

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,720
not this day an hour of wolves and

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,500
shattered shields when the age of men

8
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,749
comes crashing down but it is not this

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,750
day this day we fight

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,620
by all that you hold dear on this Good

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,620
Earth I would you start
