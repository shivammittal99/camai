1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,030
look similar everything the light

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,489
touches is our kingdom

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:15,569
a king's time as ruler rises and falls

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,870
like the Sun one day Simba the Sun will

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,630
set on my time here and will rise with

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:26,329
you as the new king and this will all be

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,190
mine everything everything light touches

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:31,949
what about that shadowy place that's

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,139
beyond all borders must never go there

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,529
but I thought a king can do whatever he

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,780
want

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,420
oh this motor being king then getting

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,080
your way all the time there's more that

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,080
Simba

15
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:49,909
everything you see exists together in a

16
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,159
delicate balance as king we need to

17
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:54,979
understand that balance and respect all

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,349
the creatures from the crawling ant to

19
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,819
the leaping antelope dad don't we eat

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,880
the Antelope yes

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,790
Simba but let me explain when we die our

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:08,599
bodies become the grass and the Antelope

23
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:13,509
eat the grass and so we are all

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,510
connected in the great circle of life
