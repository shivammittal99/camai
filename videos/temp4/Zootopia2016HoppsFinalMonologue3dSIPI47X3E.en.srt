00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:08,700
when I was a kid I thought Zootopia was

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,440
this perfect place where everyone got

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,840
along and anyone could be anything

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,940
turns out real life's a little bit more

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,559
complicated than a slogan on a bumper

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,490
sticker

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,400
real life is messy we all have

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,010
limitations we all make mistakes

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,010
which means hey glass-half-full we all

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,350
have a lot in common and the more we try

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,399
to understand one another the more

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:42,210
exceptional each of us will be but we

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,529
have to try so no matter what type of

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,940
animal you are from the biggest elephant

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,940
to our first Fox

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,190
I implore you try

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,190
try to make the world a better place

18
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:05,729
look inside yourself and recognize that

19
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:08,899
change starts with you

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:13,659
it starts with me

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,660
it starts with all of us
