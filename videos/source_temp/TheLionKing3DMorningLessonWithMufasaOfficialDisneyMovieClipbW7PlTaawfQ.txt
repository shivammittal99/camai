look
similar
everything
the
light
touches
is
our
kingdom
a
king's
time
as
ruler
rises
and
falls
like
the
Sun
one
day
Simba
the
Sun
will
set
on
my
time
here
and
will
rise
with
you
as
the
new
king
and
this
will
all
be
mine
everything
everything
light
touches
what
about
that
shadowy
place
that's
beyond
all
borders
must
never
go
there
but
I
thought
a
king
can
do
whatever
he
want
oh
this
motor
being
king
then
getting
your
way
all
the
time
there's
more
that
Simba
everything
you
see
exists
together
in
a
delicate
balance
as
king
we
need
to
understand
that
balance
and
respect
all
the
creatures
from
the
crawling
ant
to
the
leaping
antelope
dad
don't
we
eat
the
Antelope
yes
Simba
but
let
me
explain
when
we
die
our
bodies
become
the
grass
and
the
Antelope
eat
the
grass
and
so
we
are
all
connected
in
the
great
circle
of
life
