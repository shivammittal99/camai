when
I
was
a
kid
I
thought
Zootopia
was
this
perfect
place
where
everyone
got
along
and
anyone
could
be
anything
turns
out
real
life's
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
a
slogan
on
a
bumper
sticker
real
life
is
messy
we
all
have
limitations
we
all
make
mistakes
which
means
hey
glass-half-full
we
all
have
a
lot
in
common
and
the
more
we
try
to
understand
one
another
the
more
exceptional
each
of
us
will
be
but
we
have
to
try
so
no
matter
what
type
of
animal
you
are
from
the
biggest
elephant
to
our
first
Fox
I
implore
you
try
try
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
look
inside
yourself
and
recognize
that
change
starts
with
you
it
starts
with
me
it
starts
with
all
of
us
