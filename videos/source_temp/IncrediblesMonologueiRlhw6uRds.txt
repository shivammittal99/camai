it's
finally
ready
yeah
you
know
I
went
through
quite
a
few
supers
to
get
it
worthy
to
fight
you
but
man
it
wasn't
good
enough
after
you
trash
the
last
one
I
had
to
make
some
major
modifications
sure
it
was
difficult
but
you
are
worth
it
hey
after
all
I
am
your
biggest
fan
Buffy
my
name
is
not
bi
and
it's
not
incredible
either
that
ship
has
sailed
all
I
wanted
was
to
help
you
I
only
wanted
to
help
and
what
did
you
say
to
me
fly
home
buddy
I
work
alone
it
tore
me
apart
but
I
learned
an
important
lesson
you
can't
count
on
anyone
especially
your
heroes
I
was
wrong
to
treat
you
that
way
I'm
sorry
see
now
you
respect
me
because
I'm
a
threat
that's
the
way
it
works
turns
out
there
are
a
lot
of
people
whole
countries
who
want
respect
and
they
will
pay
through
the
nose
to
get
it
how
do
you
think
I
got
rich
I
invented
weapons
and
now
I
have
a
weapon
that
only
I
can
defeat
and
when
I
unleash
a
you
sly
dog
you
got
me
monologue
that's
cool
huh
zero-point
energy
yeah
I
saved
the
best
inventions
for
myself
she
was
super
I'm
single
your
nemesis
in
it
brilliant
