I
mean
not
like
a
heaven
where
you
ride
a
unicorn
all
day
and
live
in
a
mansion
made
of
clouds
but
yes
I
definitely
believe
in
something
I
mean
otherwise
what's
the
point
you
heard
me
yes
I
am
in
love
of
you
I
know
that
love
is
just
a
shout
into
the
void
and
that
oblivion
is
inevitable
and
that
we're
all
doomed
and
one
day
all
of
our
Labor's
will
be
returned
to
dust
and
I
know
that
the
Sun
will
swallow
the
only
earth
we
will
ever
have
and
I
am
in
love
with
you
sorry
