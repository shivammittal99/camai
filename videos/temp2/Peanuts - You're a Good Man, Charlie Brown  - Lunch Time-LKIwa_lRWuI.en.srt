1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:13,159
I think lunchtime is but the worst time

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:16,639
of day for me always having to sit here

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,760
alone of course sometimes mornings

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,310
aren't so pleasant either waking up and

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,460
wondering if anyone would really miss me

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,340
if I never got out of bed

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,890
then there's the night too lying there

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,370
and thinking about all the stupid things

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,950
I've done during the day and all those

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,520
hours in between when I do all those

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:43,910
stupid things well lunch time is among

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,060
the worst times of the day for me well I

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,700
guess I'd better see what I've got

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,560
peanut butter some psychiatrists say

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,330
that people who eat peanut butter

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,910
sandwiches are lonely I guess the right

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:02,230
and when you're really lonely the peanut

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,940
butter sticks to the rule for your mouth

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,330
there's that cute little redheaded girl

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,700
eating your lunch over there I wonder

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,230
what she would do that went over and

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,190
asked her if I could sit and have lunch

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:20,660
with her she'd probably laugh right in

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:25,040
my face it's hard on a face when he gets

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:28,130
laughed in there's an empty place next

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,680
to her on the bench there's no reason

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,350
why I couldn't just go over and sit

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,800
there I could do that right now

29
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,960
all I have to do is stand up I'm

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:45,660
standing up

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,380
sitting down I'm a coward I'm so much of

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,680
a coward

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,950
she wouldn't even think of looking at me

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,150
she hardly ever does look at me in fact

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,120
I can't remember her ever looking at me

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:02,040
why shouldn't she look at me is there

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,610
any reason in the world why she

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,460
shouldn't look at me she's so great and

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm so small that she can't spare one

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:16,380
little moment she's looking at me she's

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,780
looking at me you're thinking of that

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,390
other dress the one I wore to Lucinda's

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,670
party the one I'm talking about was the

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,050
very life blue one it had a design

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,130
embroidered around the waist

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,710
I don't remember something like this and

47
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,760
a skirt went out like this and had these

48
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:39,779
puffy sleeves and a sash like this oh

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,310
yes I remember yes well that was a dress

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,530
I was wearing last week when I met

51
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,450
Frieda and she told me she'd seen one

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,360
just like it over at that place on

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,720
lunchtime is among the worst times of

54
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,690
the day for me if that little redheaded

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,020
girl is looking at me with this stupid

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,040
bag over my head she must think I'm the

57
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,189
biggest fool alive but if she isn't

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,640
looking at me maybe I could take it off

59
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,780
quickly and she'd never notice it on the

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:17,610
other hand I can't tell if she's looking

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,160
until I take it off then again if I

62
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,650
never take it off I'll never have to

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,740
know if she was looking or not on the

64
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,930
other hand it's very hard to breathe it

65
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:34,899
here it's not looking at me

66
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:41,110
I wonder why she never looks at me oh

67
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,110
well another lunch hour over with only

68
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,650
2863 to
