ship and you don't you're the ones in

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:07,490

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,200
thing hiding somewhere behind a pearl

when you had the chance to show it to do

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,390
the right thing I love those moments I

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:35,390

00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,580
commandeer one of these ships pick up a

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,110

00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,040
have told us unless of course he knew

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,860
