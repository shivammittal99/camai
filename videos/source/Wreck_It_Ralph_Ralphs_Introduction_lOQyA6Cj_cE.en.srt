1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:15,240
my name's Ralph and I'm a bad guy let's

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,640
see I'm nine feet tall I weigh 643

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,670
pounds got a little bit of a temper on

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:26,960
me my passion bubble is very near the

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,220
surface I guess I'm not gonna lie

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,850
anyhoo what else I'm a wrecker I wrecked

7
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,949
things professionally I mean I'm very

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,940
good at what I do probably the best I

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,040
know the thing is fixing is the name of

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,040
the game literally fix-it Felix jr.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,380
so yeah naturally the guy with the name

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,810
fix-it Felix is the good guy he's nice

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,259
enough his good guys go definitely fix

14
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,289
his stuff really well but if you've got

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,170
a magic hammer from your father how hard

16
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,169
can it be if he was a regular contractor

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,880
carpenter guy I guarantee you you would

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,990
not be able to fix the damage that I do

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,560
as quickly when Felix does a good job he

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,350
gets a medal but are their medals for

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,520
wrecking stuff really well to that I say

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,520
ha and no there aren't

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,530
thirty years of in doing this and I've

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,970
seen a lot of other games come and go

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,470
kind of sad

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,600
think about all those guys from

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,670
asteroids boom gone

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,940
centipede who knows where that guy is

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,810
you know look a steady arcade gig is

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,880
nothing to sneeze ax

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,650
I'm very lucky it's just I gotta say it

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,690
becomes kind of hard to love your job

33
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,689
when no one seems to like you for doing

34
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,919
I'll clear the arcades close sure you

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,310
can

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,380
oooh what a day so you want to head to

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,380
tappers ken have your buying buddy

38
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:29,540
ah maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:33,020
if things were different after work but

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,990
it is what it is Felix and the nice

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:40,880
Landers go hang out in their homes which

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,880
is just fixed and everyone you know they

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,750
go to their homes I go to mine which

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,730
happens to be a dump and when I say a

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,570
dump I don't mean like a shabby place I

46
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,540
mean an actual dump the garbage goes and

47
00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:00,580
a bunch of bricks and smash building

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,530
parts that's that's what I call home I

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,030
guess I can't Billy ate too much I got

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,030
my bricks I got my stump

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:19,310
it looks uncomfortable it's actually

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:23,450
fine I'm good but if I'm really honest

53
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,670
with myself I see Felix up there getting

54
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:31,190
patted on the back people giving him pie

55
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,650
thanking him so happy to see him all the

56
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,830
time

57
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,880
some time to think man sure must be nice

58
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,880
being the good guy
