what
happened
did
I
paint
what
did
he
leave
us
did
he
leave
us
any
toys
I
know
I'm
waiting
with
a
great
bumpkin
when
I
could
have
been
out
for
trips
or
great
missed
it
you
look
at
you
got
me
up
on
that
ready
with
a
great
pumpkin
and
on
a
game
with
a
beagle
I
can
get
again
to
go
for
Crystal
cream
and
order
your
fault
I'll
show
what
a
fall
I
was
I
could
have
had
candy
apples
and
gone
I'm
conky
that
money
also
to
thing
but
no
I
had
to
listen
to
you
you
blockin
what
a
fool
I
was
quicker
tweets
come
only
once
a
year
and
I
miss
it
by
sitting
in
a
pumpkin
patch
with
a
blockhead
you
can
you
heard
about
fury
and
a
woman
scorned
haven't
you
yes
I
guess
I
have
well
that's
nothing
compared
to
the
fury
of
a
woman
who
has
been
cheated
out
of
tricks
or
treats
