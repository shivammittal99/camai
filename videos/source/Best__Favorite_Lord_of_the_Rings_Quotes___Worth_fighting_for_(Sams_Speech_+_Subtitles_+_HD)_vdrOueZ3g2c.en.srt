00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,090
I can't do this I know it's all wrong

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:29,619
but rights we shouldn't even be here

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:32,489
we are

6
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:44,789
it's like in the great stories mr.

7
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:47,479
fertile the ones that really mattered

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,770
full of darkness and danger they were

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,920
and sometimes you didn't want to know

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,040
with yet because I'm to the end be happy

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,520
how could the world go back to the way

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,520
it was when so much had happened

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,880
but in the end it's only a passing thing

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:19,090
this shadow even darkness must pass

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,370
every day will come and when the Sun

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,870
shines it will shine out the clearer

19
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,159
those are the stories that stayed with

20
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,619
you at Mensa

21
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,859
even if you were too small to understand

22
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:39,859
why I think mr. farofa

23
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:42,979
I do understand I know no folk in those

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:48,160
stories had lots of chances of turning

25
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:50,389
back only they didn't they kept going

26
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:57,279
because they were holding on to

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:57,280
something what do we all belong to Sam

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,470
but there's some good in this world mr.

30
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:17,909
Phil and it's worth fighting
