sorry
but
if
we
make
a
little
scotch
you
it's
a
key
know
much
more
better
it
is
a
drawing
of
a
key
gentlemen
what
do
please
do
keys
unlock
things
and
whatever
this
key
unlocks
inside
there's
something
valuable
so
we're
setting
out
to
find
whatever
this
key
unlocks
no
we
don't
have
the
key
we
can't
open
whatever
it
is
we
don't
have
that
it
unlocks
so
what
purpose
would
be
served
in
planning
would
ever
need
be
unlocked
which
we
don't
have
without
first
having
found
the
key
one
so
we're
going
after
this
key
you're
not
making
any
sense
for
any
more
questions
so
we
have

underneath

today
you
always
remember
the

you
want
me
to
find
it
no
you
want
you
to
find
this
because
the
finding
of
this
finds
you
incapacity
really
finding
