1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,140
I mean not like a heaven where you ride

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,959
a unicorn all day and live in a mansion

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,220
made of clouds but yes I definitely

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,370
believe in something I mean otherwise

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,369
what's the point

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,040
you heard me

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,050
yes I am in love of you I know that love

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,150
is just a shout into the void and that

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,340
oblivion is inevitable and that we're

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:52,930
all doomed and one day all of our

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,700
Labor's will be returned to dust and I

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,970
know that the Sun will swallow the only

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,510
earth we will ever have and I am in love

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,510
with you

15
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,099
sorry
