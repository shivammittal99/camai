1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,179
I'm going to show the people of Gotham

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,259
their city doesn't belong to the

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,419
criminals in the corrupt people need

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,039
dramatic examples to shake them out of

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,610
apathy and I can't do that as Bruce

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,230
Wayne as a man of flesh and blood I can

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,710
be ignored I can be destroyed but as a

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,710
symbol

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,830
but a symbol I can be incorruptible I

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:33,950
can be everlasting what simple something

11
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:36,309
elemental something terrifying I'm

12
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,309
Batman

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:51,410
nice coat the idea was to be a symbol

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,410
that man

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,250

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,450
if you're working alone wear a mask not

17
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,909
afraid to be seen standing up these guys

18
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:08,239

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,320

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:28,660
