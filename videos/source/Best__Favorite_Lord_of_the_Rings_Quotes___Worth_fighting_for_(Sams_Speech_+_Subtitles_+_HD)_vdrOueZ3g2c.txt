I
can't
do
this
I
know
it's
all
wrong
but
rights
we
shouldn't
even
be
here
[Music]
we
are
[Music]
it's
like
in
the
great
stories
mr.
fertile
the
ones
that
really
mattered
full
of
darkness
and
danger
they
were
and
sometimes
you
didn't
want
to
know
with
yet
because
I'm
to
the
end
be
happy
[Music]
how
could
the
world
go
back
to
the
way
it
was
when
so
much
had
happened
but
in
the
end
it's
only
a
passing
thing
this
shadow
even
darkness
must
pass
every
day
will
come
and
when
the
Sun
shines
it
will
shine
out
the
clearer
[Music]
those
are
the
stories
that
stayed
with
you
at
Mensa
even
if
you
were
too
small
to
understand
why
I
think
mr.
farofa
I
do
understand
I
know
no
folk
in
those
stories
had
lots
of
chances
of
turning
back
only
they
didn't
they
kept
going
because
they
were
holding
on
to
something
what
do
we
all
belong
to
Sam
[Music]
but
there's
some
good
in
this
world
mr.
Phil
and
it's
worth
fighting
[Music]
you
