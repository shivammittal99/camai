take
hydrogen
you
add
oxygen
you
burn
now
I
have
hundreds
of
liters
of
unused
hydrazine
at
the
MDV
if
I
run
the
hydrazine
over
an
Iridium
catalyst
it'll
separate
into
n2
and
h2
and
then
if
I
just
direct
the
hydrogen
into
a
small
area
and
burn
it
luckily
in
the
history
of
humanity
nothing
bad
has
ever
happened
from
gliding
hydrogen
on
fire
NASA
hates
fire
because
of
the
whole
fire
makes
everybody
die
in
space
thing
so
everything
they
sent
us
up
here
with
his
flames
argued
with
the
notable
exception
of
Martinez's
personal
items
I
am
sorry
Martinez
but
if
you
didn't
want
me
to
go
through
your
stuff
you
should
know
left
me
for
dead
on
a
desolate
planet
by
the
way
I'm
figuring
you're
going
to
be
fine
with
this
given
my
present
situation
counting
on
you
so
yeah
I
blew
myself
up
best
guess
I
forgot
to
account
for
the
excess
oxygen
I've
been
exhaling
I
did
my
calculations
because
I'm
stupid
I'm
gonna
get
back
to
work
here
just
as
soon
as
my
ears
stop
ringing
interesting
side
note
this
is
actually
how
the
jet
propulsion
lab
was
founded
five
guys
at
Caltech
trying
to
make
rocket
fuel
and
they
nearly
burned
down
their
dorm
and
rather
than
expel
them
banished
them
to
a
nearby
farm
told
him
to
keep
working
now
we
have
a
space
program
okay
