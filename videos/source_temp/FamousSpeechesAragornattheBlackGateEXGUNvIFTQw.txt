my
brother
I
see
in
your
eyes
the
same
fear
that
would
take
the
heart
for
me
a
day
may
come
when
the
courage
of
men
fails
when
we
forsake
our
friends
and
break
all
bonds
of
fellowship
but
it
is
not
this
day
an
hour
of
wolves
and
shattered
shields
when
the
age
of
men
comes
crashing
down
but
it
is
not
this
day
this
day
we
fight
by
all
that
you
hold
dear
on
this
Good
Earth
I
would
you
start
