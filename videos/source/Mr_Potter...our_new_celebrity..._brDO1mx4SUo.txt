there
will
be
no
foolish
wand-waving
or
silly
incantations
in
this
class
as
such
I
don't
expect
many
of
you
to
appreciate
the
subtle
science
and
exact
art
that
is
potion
making
however
for
those
select
few
who
possess
the
predisposition
I
can
teach
you
how
to
bewitch
the
mind
and
ensnare
the
senses
I
can
tell
you
how
to
bottle
fame
brew
glory
and
even
put
a
stopper
in
death
then
again
maybe
some
of
you
have
come
to
Hogwarts
in
possession
of
abilities
so
formidable
that
you
feel
confident
enough
to
not
pay
attention
mr.
Potter
our
new
celebrity
tell
me
what
would
I
get
if
I
added
powdered
root
of
asphodel
to
an
infusion
of
wormwood
you
don't
know
well
let's
try
again
where
mr.
Potter
would
you
look
at
if
I
asked
you
to
find
me
a
bezoar
I
don't
know
sir
and
what
is
the
difference
between
monkshood
and
wolfbane
I
don't
know
sir
petty
clearly
Fame
isn't
everything
is
it
mr.
Potter
