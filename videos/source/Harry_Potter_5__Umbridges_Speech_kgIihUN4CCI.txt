we
also
wish
to
welcome
our
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
professor
Dolores
Umbridge
and
I'm
sure
you'll
all
join
me
in
wishing
the
professor
good
luck
as

our
caretaker
mr.
Filch
has
asked
me
to
remind

headmaster
has
brought
something
new
to
this
historic
school
Progress
for
the
sake
of
progress
must
be
discouraged
let

to
be
prohibited
Thank
You
professor
umbrage
